        <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
        <div>Yes, I do have a little bit of programming and web design experience. In the intro to IT course, I had had
          to create a web page as an assignment and other assignments also required me to write essays on a website.
          Therefore, it was obvious that I had learned how to built a simple web page and use HTML.</div>

        <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
        <div>More like a programmer than a designer. Designing requires a creative brain, but I'm good at doing things that have fixed steps or formulas to follow.  </div>

        <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
        <div>

              front-end web developer. therefore, I need to participate in this course.</li>
            <li>Secondly, this is a compulsory course of IT program. It is needed to take this course in order to finish the program.</li>

              <p> It means that I want to learn the true definition of the internet and how a Webpage works </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Mastering web programming languages</p>
              <p> After the course, I hope that I can fully understand HTML and CSS and be able to use them to build a website</p>
