        <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
        <div>Yes, I do have a little bit of programming and web design experience. In the intro to IT course, I had had
          to create a web page as an assignment and other assignments also required me to write essays on a website.
          Therefore, it was obvious that I had learned how to built a simple web page and use HTML.</div>

        <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
        <div>More like a programmer than a designer. Designing requires a creative brain, but I'm only good at doing things
          that have fixed steps or formulas to follow. It is hard for me to be creative when I work.</div>

        <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
        <div>
          <p>There are two reasons why I take this course:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Firstly, this course is essential to my career. As I said on <a href="https://haonguyen3817884.github.io/">my own webpage</a>, I would like to be a
              front-end web developer after I finish my study. therefore, I need to participate in this course.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Secondly, this is a compulsory course of IT program. It is needed to take this course in order to finish
              the program.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
        <div>
          <p>Things that I hope to achieve:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><u><strong>Having a deep understanding of the internet and world wide web</strong></u> </p>
            </li>

              <p>- It means that I want to learn the true definition of the internet and how a Webpage works </p>
            
            <li>
              <p> <u><strong>Mastering web programming languages</strong></u> </p>
            </li>  
            <p>- After the course, I hope that I can fully understand HTML and CSS and be able to use them to build a
                website  </p>
            
          </ul>
        </div>

                <li>(moderately) Responsible:</li>
                <p>- When working in a group, I try to take the work serious, for example attending all the group meetings or never submitting assigned works late. This could help improve the final result of the
                  group </p>
                <li>(moderately) Careful:</li>
                <p>- Before I submit my work, I often spend hours checking it so common mistakes can be eliminated </p>
